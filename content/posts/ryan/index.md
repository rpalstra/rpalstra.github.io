{{< img "ryan_sign.jpg" "Ryan Palstra" >}}

Ryan Palstra was born August 13th, 2025 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. After a
few days at a Birth Center, he and his mother are now resting at home. He is
all healthy and sleeps a lot. Due to his face, the look in his eyes, his length
of 52 centimeters and long legs, I have a sneaky suspicion he's mine ;)
